PWM units are clocked at 1Ghz

Period should be around 15microseconds

Duty about 50ns

11turns primary,
12 turns secondary


import Adafruit_BBIO.PWM as PWM
#PWM.start("P8_19",0.5,55000) #runs best with 1.2ohm resistor
#PWM.start("P8_19",0.5,52000) #maybe need to run this twice?

PWM.cleanup()  #this sometimes causes errors?

#it seems that the usb power is turned off when a device is plugged in with the BBB running?!
#but this only seems to work once per reboot??
